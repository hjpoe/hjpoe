- 👋 Hi, I’m @hjpoe. I'd like to make the world a better place using code. I'm somewhat self-taught, but I went to college for Software Engineering for 
 a time and didn't finish that path. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Games. This is *far* from an extensive list, I'm interested in so many
 other things as well. I'm interested in learning TensorFlow.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Machine Learning. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence projects in Python 🐍
- 📫 How to reach me ... IDEK, are there messages on here somewhere? I don't have Twitter or Hive.
